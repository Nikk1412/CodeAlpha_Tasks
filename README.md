### 1. Credit Scoring Model
Develop a credit scoring model that predicts the creditworthiness of individuals using historical financial data. Utilize various classification algorithms to assess the model's accuracy. The model aims to provide insights into whether an individual is likely to be a good or bad credit risk based on their financial history.

### 2. Emotion Recognition from Speech
Build a model for emotion recognition from speech audio. Leveraging deep learning and speech processing techniques, the model classifies spoken sentences into different emotions such as happiness, anger, or sadness. This task involves the use of advanced techniques to capture and analyze emotional cues from audio data.

### 3. Disease Prediction from Medical Data
Create a disease prediction model based on medical data, including symptoms and patient history. Utilize datasets with labeled medical records and apply classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of a disease. The model aims to assist in early detection by analyzing patient information and identifying potential health issues.

These tasks encompass a diverse range of machine learning applications, from financial risk assessment to speech emotion recognition and healthcare-related disease prediction. Each task requires the application of classification algorithms and showcases the versatility of machine learning in solving real-world problems.
